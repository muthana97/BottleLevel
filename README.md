# BottleLevel
Project using python and OpenCV to determine the level of water in a bottle.

This is a water level detection system that uses machine vision. Libraries used are
numpy, openCV, Tkinter, and time.

The system is still in testing phase and requires extra calibration. When using it is advised to have a 
white background behind the bottle on which The liquid level is to be detected.

For Calibration re-position the distance of the cam, and the object until the height printed on screen is accurate 
enough and mark that location or distance as it depends on the camera in use. It is highly recommended to use an
external webcam.
